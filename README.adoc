= Launchpad Jenkins Slave Dockerfile

== Custom Jenkins Slave
* Tuned to support running in a constrained cloud environment (OpenShift Online Free)
* Extends from `openshift/jenkins-slave-maven-centos7:latest`
* Installs `i686` JDK and removes `x86_84` JDK (slimmer memory profile)
* Sets `_JAVA_OPTIONS` to keep `java` and `javac` processes from overextending available memory
